# GarageDoors-ESP8266-MicroPython-
[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)
I've used ESP8266 as my main board for opening/closing my garage doors. 
Also added some sensors for more accurate prediction whether doors are opened or closed.

In this project, I've used:
-ESP8266 flashed with MicroPython(sadly)
-UltraSonic Sensor(HC-SR04) to predict whether garage doors are opened or closed
-DHT22 for basic temp,hum stats.
